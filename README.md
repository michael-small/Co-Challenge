# CoChallenge

CoSchedule coding challenge to make a fullstack CRUD site

### Requirements:

* Pick a pre-approved API
* Backend: Create API for CRUD, include comment system
* Frontend: Search data source, user can rate an item
* e2e auth as a bonus

### Stack 

* API: undecided at the moment
* Backend: Express + Mongoose
* Frontend: create-react-app
* e2e: Google OAuth w/Passport.js
* Misc:
  * Styling: Material UI + SCSS + styled-components

### How to Run Project

From the project root:

`npm run dev`

That starts the client and server [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently). 
Additionally, the server runs with [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon),so it can 
update while running if a server file changes.

### Docs

See `~/Documentation` for some of my thinking and notes.

Also, see [my Personal React Notes](https://github.com/michael-small/Personal-React-Notes/tree/main) repo where I journal helpful lessons and boilerplate for my various React projects.
