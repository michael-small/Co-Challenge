# CoChallenge

CoSchedule coding challenge to make a fullstack CRUD site

### Requirements:

* Pick a pre-approved API
* Backend: Create API for CRUD, include comment system
* Frontend: Search data source, user can rate an item
* e2e auth as a bonus

### Stack 

* API: GitHub
* Backend: Express + Mongoose
* Frontend: create-react-app
* e2e: Google or GitHub OAuth w/Passport.js
* Misc:
  * Styling: Material UI + SCSS + styled-components

### How to Run Project

From the project root:

`npm run dev`

That starts the client and server [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently). 
Additionally, the server runs with [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon),so it can 
update while running if a server file changes.

### Making PR's

PRs while in development should go into the `development` branch. `development` is an acceptable place 
to rush in PRs that are not fully QA'd. I can't really review my own PRs, other than perhaps if I slept on them. 
And though I am attempting to have a structured, methodical and professional approach to making this project, this 
project is ultimately something I need to produce as quick as possible so I can return to my ongoing work on my 
family's *already lucrative* [estate sale site](https://github.com/michael-small/Eds-Garage-Sale) and the [learning program demo](https://github.com/michael-small/Witty) that I am making for a family friend's business.
